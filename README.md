## Introduction

Depression is a prevalent psychiatric disorder affecting approximately 20% of U.S. adults, posing significant public health and economic burdens.

## Objective 

This study aims to analyze the association between education level and depression among U.S. adults ≥ 20 years old, using the NHANES 2017-prepandemic March 2020 data.

## Methods

A cross-sectional design was utilized with N=7,812. Depression was assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). Univariable, bivariable, and multivariable logistic and linear regression analyses were used to examine the association between education level and depression, controlling for confounders such as age, race/ethnicity, and health insurance coverage, and exploring the effect measure modification by gender. 

## Results

Higher education levels were significantly associated with lower odds and scores of depression, particularly for college graduates or above (OR ≈ 0.40-0.45, β ≈ -0.88 to -0.79). Lower education levels, lower income, and certain demographic characteristics (e.g., being female, younger age, being single, being a part of the Other Race – Including Multi-Racial racial/ethnic group) significantly increased the odds and scores of depression. Health insurance coverage did not have a confounding effect. 

## Conclusion

There is an inverse relationship between education level and depression among U.S. adults ≥ 20 years old. These findings highlight the importance of education in mitigating depression and suggest that policies aimed at increasing access to education should be implemented to reduce the burden of depression, thus improving overall public health. Future longitudinal studies are recommended to confirm these findings and explore the causal relationship between education level and depression.
